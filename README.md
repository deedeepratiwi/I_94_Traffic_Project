# I_94_Traffic_Project
 
In this project, we are going to analyze a dataset about the westbound traffic on the I-94 Interstate Highway in the US (cars moving from east to west). The traffic data recorded from a station located approximately midway between Minneapolis and Saint Paul.

The goal of our analysis is to determine a few indicators of heavy traffic on I-94. These indicators can be weather type, time of the day, time of the week, etc.

Dataset can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Metro+Interstate+Traffic+Volume).
